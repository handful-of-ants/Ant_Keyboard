# Ant_Keyboard
A 78 key ultra-wide mechanical keyboard made by Handful_Of_Ants

This keyboard was designed with Keyboard Layout Editor. It includes a function cluster (1-12), stepped capslock, 10u spacebar, "Big Ass Enter", 2.75u backspace, and a numpad. It is essentially a full-size keyboard with the function cluster moved, no number row, and the layout changed to fit what I wanted. All files are available for commercial and personal use.
